# Rocket Launch Analysis
This repository contains code which fetches freely available rocket launch data and analyses it. 
Future plan is to join weather data to this launch data and predict if rocket will be launched or not.

# Things to do after you have cloned the code
1. Install virtual environment using
> python -m venv env
> source env/bin/activate

This will activate the environment which is unique for this project.
